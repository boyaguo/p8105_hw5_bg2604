According to the plot produced, we could find that there is an increase in the observations of experimental groups as time increases. However, the change in the control group seems to fluctuate between -1.25 and 3.75, with no apparent change as time increases.

Accroding to the plot produced, we could find that Chicago, New Orleans and Baltimore had the highest estimates of unsolved homicides among 50 cities. There is a significant gap between the estimates of Chicago and New Orleans. In addition, Richmond, Charlotte, and Memphis had the lowest estimates of unsolved homicides.
